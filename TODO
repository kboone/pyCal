- Sometimes there is a Copyright Restriction Download Warning when you try to
  download files... figure out what to do with this. eg: the first midterm for
  PHYS 7A.
- Figure out how to deal with URLs when files come up
- Find some way to do an incremental download so that I don't redownload
  everything every time I do a download() call. I am given update times in
  Sakai... I can probably write those to the files that are downloaded and check
  if they have been updated.
